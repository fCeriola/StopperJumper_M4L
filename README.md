# StopperJumper_M4L
_Max4Live device for Ableton Live_

Automated Live music performances are nowadys a fundation for self produced/promoted artists that perform as a one-man-band.
Most of those performances are based on sequences and loops directly programmed into a DAW, commonly Ableton, so each instrument, effect or looper is fully automated within the timeline.

This device allows you to further push this process, giving the possibility to automatically **STOP** the playback in the arranger view and **JUMP** to the next locator placed in your timeline.


## Requirements
- Ableton Live Suite
    - Unfortunately Max4Live is not available for Lite or Standard version of Ableton.
- StopperJumper_M4L
    - Download zip folder from github, move the M4L device inside the Ableton User Library path (Macintosh HD/Users/username/Music/Ableton/User Library/M4L)

## Workflow

1. Create a MIDI track and insert the StopperJumper_M4L.
2. Select the MIDI note that will trigger the **STOP** (click and scroll on the note).
3. Create a MIDI clip on the track with the StopperJumper_M4L.
4. Inside the clip draw a note that correspond to the one selected before inside the StopperJumper_M4L.
5. Press play, when the transport will hit the note the playback will stop and the transport will jump to the next marker. Note trigger and "NEXT" led will flash.
